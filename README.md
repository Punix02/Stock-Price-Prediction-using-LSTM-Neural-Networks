# Stock-Price-Prediction-using-LSTM-Neural-Networks
This project focuses on predicting stock market prices using advanced Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architectures, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. It demonstrates both offline forecasting using historical data and real-time adaptive prediction using live stock data fetched from Yahoo Finance.
